Practical experimentation of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks based on the study "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Kipf, et al ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907))

The model has been tested using 3 different approaches:
- Importing dataset from files
- Importing dataset making use of Torch Geometric
- Training the model using DGL framework
